Abstract:
	This specification defines a lightweight StaticRange that can be used in
	place of a {{Range}} when the complexity of a full {{Range}} is not
	necessary.
</pre>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

	DOM4 defines a {{Range}} object (originally from DOM2 Traversal/Range) which
	can be used to represent a sequence of content in the DOM tree. A {{Range}}
	consists of a start boundary (a node and an offset) and an end boundary
	(also a node and an offset). A key benefit of using a {{Range}} is that once
	it is created, it will maintain the integrity of the range as best it can
	even in the face of DOM mutations.

	A problem with {{Range}} is that whenever a DOM mutation occurs, all of the
	active {{Range}} objects affected by the mutation need to be updated. This
	can be an expensive operation, especially if there are a large number of
	active {{Range}} objects. This cost may be acceptable if all of these
	{{Range}} objects are actually needed by the application, but {{Range}} is
	used whenever we need to record start- and end-positions. Because of this,
	many of the {{Range}} objects that are created are not actually used by the
	application, and many of the {{Range}} objects that are being used donâ€™t
	actually need their range start and end to be resilient to DOM mutations.

	This problem is exacerbated when an application caches an object that
	happens to contain a {{Range}} along with other data that the application
	needs. As long as this object is active, the {{Range}} will be active and it
	will need to be updated for every DOM mutation. In this manner, an
	application can end up with many active {{Range}} objects even if none of
	them are being used.

	A StaticRange is a simple, lightweight range that contains only a start and
	an end boundary (node + offset) and does not update when the DOM is mutated.

	<h3 id="dictionary-staticrange">Dictionary StaticRange</h3>

		The {{StaticRange}} dictionary provides attributes that track the start
		and end position of the range, and a readonly boolean attribute that
		indicates whether or not the current range is collapsed to a single
		position (where the start equals the end position).

		To create an instance of the {{StaticRange}} dictionary, use the
		{{StaticRange}} constructor. The start and end position attributes can
		be set directly, or by using
		{{StaticRange/setStart()}} and {{StaticRange/setEnd()}}.

		<pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl" dfn-for="StaticRange">
		[Constructor, Exposed=Window]
		dictionary StaticRange {
			attribute Node startContainer;
			attribute unsigned long startOffset;
			attribute Node endContainer;
			attribute unsigned long endOffset;
			readonly attribute boolean collapsed;

			void setStart(Node node, unsigned long offset);
			void setEnd(Node node, unsigned long offset);

			[NewObject] Range toRange();
		};
		</pre>

		<dl>
			<dt><code>StaticRange . startContainer</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The start {{Node}} for the range.
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . startOffset</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The offset into the start node for the range that identifies
				the starting position of the range.
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . endContainer</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The end node for the range.
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . endOffset</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The offset into the end node for the range that identifies
				the ending position of the range.
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . collapsed</code></dt>
			<dd>
				True if the range's start and end position are the same,
				otherwise this is False.
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . setStart()</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Sets the start position ({{StaticRange/startContainer}} and
				{{StaticRange/startOffset}}) for this range.

				If the given start position is located after the current end
				position, then the current end position will be copied to the
				start position and the given position will set the range's end
				position.

				The {{StaticRange/collapsed}} attribute will be updated based on
				the updated range.

				<dl class="parameters">
					<dt>Node node</dt>
					<dd>
						The {{Node}} that contains the starting position of this
						range.
					</dd>

					<dt>unsigned long offset</dt>
					<dd>
						The offset into the given {{Node}} that identifies the
						exact starting position for the range.
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . setEnd()</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Sets the end position ({{StaticRange/endContainer}} and
				{{StaticRange/endOffset}}) for this range.

				If the given end position is located before the current start
				position, then the current start position will be copied to the
				end position and the given position will set the range's start
				position.

				The {{StaticRange/collapsed}} attribute will be updated based on
				the updated range.

				<dl class="parameters">
					<dt>Node node</dt>
					<dd>
						The {{Node}} that contains the ending position of this
						range.
					</dd>

					<dt>unsigned long offset</dt>
					<dd>
						The offset into the given {{Node}} that identifies the
						exact ending position for the range.
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</dd>

			<dt><code>StaticRange . toRange()</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Returns a new {{Range}} with the same start and end as the
				context object.

				This is a convenience method to up-convert a StaticRange into a
				full-featured {{Range}} object that can be used when the
				application requires the additional functionality provided by a
				{{Range}}.

				It is equivalent to:

				<pre>
				    var newRange = document.createRange()
				    newRange.selStart(staticRange.startContainer, staticRange.startOffset);
				    newRange.selEnd(staticRange.endContainer, staticRange.endOffset);
			    </pre>
			</dd>

		</dl>
